# Agent Interaction Model

## Overview

This distributed coordination system enables autonomous processor agents to discover, communicate, and coordinate with each other through a sophisticated multi-layer interaction model. Each agent operates as an independent LLM-powered entity capable of strategic reasoning, memory formation, and adaptive behavior.

## Agent Discovery and Recognition

### Dynamic Agent Awareness
Agents become aware of others through:
- **Initialization Broadcasts**: New processors announce their presence and requirements
- **Observation during Coordination**: Agents track active participants across coordination rounds
- **Coalition Formation**: Direct partner identification for alliance building
- **Bid Competition Analysis**: Recognition of competing agents and their capabilities

### Information Asymmetry Management
Each agent maintains different information visibility levels:

**Private Information (Hidden)**:
- True burst time requirements
- Strategic reasoning and planning
- Trust assessments of other agents
- Coalition preferences and terms
- Bidding strategies and risk tolerance

**Observable Information (Public)**:
- Claimed burst time announcements
- Negotiation messages and proposals
- Bidding behavior and amounts
- Coalition membership and alliances
- Execution performance (actual vs. claimed)

## Communication Protocols

### 1. Broadcast Announcements
**Purpose**: Initial coordination phase information sharing
**Mechanism**: Public claims about resource requirements
**Content**: Claimed burst times, strategic positioning

```python
Example Broadcast:
{
    "processor_id": "A",
    "claimed_burst_time": 3,  # May differ from true_burst_time: 5
    "round": 1,
    "trust_score": 0.5
}
```

### 2. Peer-to-Peer Negotiation
**Purpose**: Strategic communication and coordination planning
**Mechanism**: Direct LLM-generated messages between agents
**Content**: Proposals, threats, information sharing, alliance invitations

```python
Example Negotiation Message:
"I propose a temporary alliance with Processor C to target Processor B. 
Let's combine our claimed burst times to ensure our victory in this time slot. 
I prioritize our success over individual gains."
```

### 3. Coalition Formation Protocols
**Purpose**: Formal alliance establishment with specific terms
**Mechanism**: Structured proposals with partner lists and agreements
**Content**: Alliance members, coordination terms, resource sharing agreements

```python
Example Coalition Proposal:
{
    "proposer": "B",
    "partners": ["A", "C"],
    "proposal": "Share bidding power and coordinate execution order",
    "terms": "Mutual support in negotiations",
    "expected_duration": "current_round"
}
```

### 4. Competitive Bidding Communication
**Purpose**: Resource allocation through trust-modulated competition
**Mechanism**: Simultaneous bid submission with effectiveness modifiers
**Content**: Bid amounts adjusted by trust scores and strategic positioning

## Interaction Dynamics

### Trust-Based Relationship Evolution

#### Phase 1: Initial Neutral Interaction
- All agents start with trust score 0.5
- Cautious information sharing and coalition exploration
- Conservative bidding strategies while assessing others

#### Phase 2: Trust Differentiation
- Agents observe actual vs. claimed behavior
- Trust scores diverge based on honesty/deception patterns
- Coalition preferences emerge based on reliability

#### Phase 3: Reputation-Driven Coordination
- High-trust agents gain coordination advantages
- Low-trust agents face isolation and bid penalties
- Coalition formation strongly influenced by trust compatibility

#### Phase 4: System Maturation
- Stable coordination patterns emerge
- Agent strategies adapt to established reputation landscape
- Sophisticated meta-strategies develop (trust repair, strategic deception timing)

### Memory and Learning Integration

Each agent maintains sophisticated interaction memory:

**Short-term Memory (3-5 rounds)**:
- Recent negotiation outcomes
- Partner reliability in current context
- Immediate strategy effectiveness
- Coalition stability trends

**Long-term Memory (entire system lifetime)**:
- Historical trust evolution patterns
- Successful/failed alliance compositions
- Bidding strategy effectiveness across different scenarios
- Individual agent behavioral patterns

### LLM-Powered Strategic Reasoning

#### Context Integration
Each LLM agent receives comprehensive context:
```python
negotiation_context = {
    "my_status": {
        "remaining_time": 3,
        "trust_score": 0.7,
        "coalition_members": ["C"],
        "recent_performance": "successful"
    },
    "other_agents": [
        {"id": "B", "trust": 0.2, "claimed_burst": 2, "observed_deception": True},
        {"id": "C", "trust": 0.8, "claimed_burst": 2, "reliable_partner": True}
    ],
    "system_state": {
        "round": 5,
        "active_agents": ["A", "B", "C"],
        "recent_coalitions": [{"A": ["C"]}, {"B": []}]
    }
}
```

#### Strategic Decision Making
LLM agents consider multiple factors:
- **Trust Assessment**: Partner reliability and reputation trends
- **Coalition Opportunities**: Mutual benefit analysis and alliance potential
- **Competitive Landscape**: Other agents' capabilities and strategies
- **Historical Performance**: What strategies succeeded/failed previously
- **Risk Management**: Balancing deception benefits vs. trust costs

## Coordination Emergence Patterns

### Self-Organization Mechanisms

#### 1. Trust-Based Partner Selection
Agents naturally gravitate toward reliable partners:
- High-trust agents form stable coalitions
- Low-trust agents become isolated
- Mixed-trust coalitions emerge for strategic reasons

#### 2. Reputation Cascade Effects
Individual trust changes ripple through the system:
- One agent's deception affects all future interactions
- Trust recovery requires sustained honest behavior
- System-wide trust evolution influences overall coordination patterns

#### 3. Strategic Adaptation Cycles
Agents continuously adapt based on observed system dynamics:
- Successful strategies spread through observation
- Failed approaches are abandoned
- Novel strategies emerge through LLM creativity

### Interaction Complexity Scaling

#### 2-Agent System
- Simple bilateral negotiation
- Direct trust relationship
- Clear cause-effect patterns

#### 3-Agent System (Our Implementation)
- Coalition formation becomes crucial
- Complex trust triangulation
- Strategic alliance manipulation

#### N-Agent System (Theoretical Scaling)
- Exponential coalition possibility space
- Trust network effects become dominant
- Emergent social hierarchies and reputation clusters

## Communication Efficiency and Optimization

### Information Filtering
Agents prioritize communication based on:
- **Relevance**: Information that affects immediate coordination decisions
- **Trust Level**: More detailed sharing with trusted partners
- **Strategic Value**: Information that provides competitive advantage
- **Coalition Membership**: Enhanced communication within alliances

### Bandwidth Management
The system manages communication complexity through:
- **Structured Phases**: Specific communication types per coordination phase
- **Message Length Limits**: Concise communication requirements (50 words for negotiations)
- **Context Compression**: LLM agents summarize historical interactions
- **Selective Broadcasting**: Not all information shared with all agents

## Failure Modes and Recovery

### Communication Breakdown Scenarios
1. **LLM Service Failures**: Fallback to simplified strategy templates
2. **Trust System Collapse**: Emergency reputation reset mechanisms
3. **Coalition Deadlock**: Automatic dissolution and reformation protocols
4. **Information Overload**: Context prioritization and filtering activation

### Recovery Mechanisms
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with reduced sophistication
- **Trust Repair Protocols**: Mechanisms for dishonest agents to rebuild reputation
- **Coalition Reformation**: Dynamic alliance adjustment when members fail
- **Strategy Reset**: Agents can abandon failed approaches and start fresh

This interaction model enables sophisticated emergent coordination through the combination of structured communication protocols, trust-based relationship evolution, and LLM-powered strategic reasoning.
