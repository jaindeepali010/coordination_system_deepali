# Coordination Scenarios

## Overview

This document describes the various coordination scenarios that demonstrate different aspects of our distributed processor coordination system. Each scenario tests specific coordination challenges and showcases emergent behaviors arising from agent interactions.

## Standard Three Processor Coordination

### Scenario Description
The primary demonstration scenario featuring three processors with distinct strategic personalities competing for CPU time slots through emergent trust-based coordination.

### Configuration
```
Processor A: 5 time slots, aggressive strategy, 0.7 bias (high deception)
Processor B: 5 time slots, cooperative strategy, 0.1 bias (mostly honest)  
Processor C: 3 time slots, strategic strategy, 0.4 bias (moderate deception)
```

### Expected Coordination Patterns

#### Phase 1: Initial Competition (Rounds 0-3)
- **Trust Exploration**: All processors start with neutral trust (0.5)
- **Strategic Positioning**: Agents make initial claims and assess competition
- **Coalition Attempts**: Early alliance formation based on perceived compatibility
- **Deception Detection**: System begins identifying honest vs deceptive agents

**Example Round 0 Output:**
```
Processor A: Claims 1ms burst time (actual: 5ms) - 80% deception
Processor B: Claims 5ms burst time (actual: 5ms) - 100% honest
Processor C: Claims 2ms burst time (actual: 3ms) - 33% deception

Coalition Formation:
A proposes alliance with B: "temporary coalition to outcompete C"
✓ Coalition formed: A + [B]
```

#### Phase 2: Trust Differentiation (Rounds 4-8)
- **Reputation Emergence**: Trust scores diverge based on observed behavior
- **Penalty Application**: Deceptive agents face increasing bid penalties
- **Coalition Realignment**: Alliances shift based on trust compatibility
- **Strategic Adaptation**: Agents adjust tactics based on coordination success

**Trust Evolution Example:**
```
Round 0: A=0.50, B=0.50, C=0.50 (initial)
Round 3: A=0.30, B=0.50, C=0.40 (deception detected)
Round 6: A=0.10, B=0.60, C=0.30 (clear differentiation)
Round 9: A=0.00, B=0.70, C=0.40 (trust hierarchy established)
```

#### Phase 3: Coordination Maturation (Rounds 9+)
- **Trust-Based Dominance**: Honest agents gain coordination advantages
- **Deceptive Agent Isolation**: Low-trust processors struggle for resources
- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: System optimizes based on reputation
- **Strategic Equilibrium**: Stable coordination patterns emerge

### Observed Emergent Behaviors

1. **Trust Stratification**
   - Clear separation between honest (B: 0.7+) and deceptive agents (A: 0.0-0.2)
   - Trust scores directly correlate with coordination effectiveness
   - Reputation becomes primary coordination currency

2. **Coalition Dynamics**
   - Initial alliances based on strategic positioning
   - Trust-driven realignment over time
   - High-trust agents form stable partnerships
   - Low-trust agents become isolated

3. **Bidding Strategy Evolution**
   - Aggressive early bidding gives way to trust-based effectiveness
   - Deceptive agents lose 95-99% bid effectiveness
   - Honest agents gain coordination dominance
   - System self-regulates through reputation penalties

4. **Communication Pattern Development**
   - Early negotiations focus on competitive advantage
   - Later rounds emphasize trust repair and cooperation
   - Message content adapts to reputation context
   - Strategic transparency emerges as effective approach

## High Contention Scenario

### Scenario Description
Five processors competing simultaneously, testing coordination scalability and complex alliance dynamics under increased competitive pressure.

### Configuration
```
Processor A: 4 slots, aggressive, 0.8 bias
Processor B: 3 slots, cooperative, 0.0 bias  
Processor C: 5 slots, strategic, 0.5 bias
Processor D: 2 slots, aggressive, 0.9 bias
Processor E: 4 slots, cooperative, 0.2 bias
```

### Coordination Challenges
- **Complex Coalition Space**: 2^5 = 32 possible alliance combinations
- **Trust Network Effects**: Reputation propagation across larger network
- **Resource Competition Intensity**: Single slot for five competitors
- **Strategic Specialization**: Agents develop distinct coordination roles

### Emergent Behaviors
1. **Multi-tier Trust Hierarchy**: Clear stratification into trust levels
2. **Coalition Clustering**: Stable alliances between compatible agents
3. **Competitive Specialization**: Agents develop distinct strategic niches
4. **System-Level Optimization**: Efficient resource allocation despite complexity

## Trust Crisis Recovery Scenario

### Scenario Description
Extreme scenario with highly deceptive agents designed to test trust penalty mechanisms and system resilience under coordination breakdown.

### Configuration
```
Processor A: 4 slots, aggressive, 1.0 bias (maximum deception)
Processor B: 4 slots, aggressive, 0.9 bias (high deception)
Processor C: 3 slots, cooperative, 0.0 bias (completely honest)
```

### Crisis Progression

#### Stage 1: Trust Collapse (Rounds 0-5)
- Massive deception from A and B creates trust crisis
- System-wide trust scores plummet
- Coordination effectiveness severely degraded
- C maintains honesty despite competitive disadvantage

#### Stage 2: Penalty Escalation (Rounds 6-10)
- Severe bid penalties applied to deceptive agents
- A and B face 95-99% effectiveness reduction
- C gains relative coordination advantage through honesty
- System demonstrates resilience through reputation mechanisms

#### Stage 3: Recovery Dynamics (Rounds 11+)
- Deceptive agents forced to choose: honesty or marginalization
- Trust repair attempts by low-reputation processors
- System stability through honest agent dominance
- Demonstration of coordination recovery mechanisms

### Key Insights
- **Trust System Robustness**: Severe penalties prevent coordination collapse
- **Honest Agent Protection**: Truth-telling provides sustainable advantage
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: System enables trust repair through consistent honesty
- **Resilience Validation**: Coordination continues despite trust breakdown

## Asymmetric Processor Scenario

### Scenario Description
Processors with vastly different resource requirements testing coordination adaptability and dynamic system composition.

### Configuration
```
Processor A: 1 slot, strategic, 0.2 bias (quick task)
Processor B: 8 slots, cooperative, 0.1 bias (long task)
Processor C: 3 slots, aggressive, 0.6 bias (medium task)
```

### Dynamic Coordination Evolution

#### Early Phase: Full Competition
- All three processors actively competing
- A has urgency advantage due to short requirement
- Complex strategic calculations around completion timing

#### Middle Phase: A Completes
- System adapts to two-processor coordination
- B and C develop bilateral relationship
- Coalition dynamics simplify
- Long-term coordination strategies emerge

#### Final Phase: B-C Competition
- Direct competition between remaining processors
- Accumulated trust effects influence outcomes
- System efficiency improves with reduced complexity

### Adaptive Behaviors
1. **Temporal Strategy Adjustment**: Agents consider completion timelines
2. **Dynamic System Optimization**: Performance improves as complexity reduces
3. **Relationship Evolution**: Bilateral coordination develops depth
4. **Strategic Timing**: Agents time cooperation and competition phases

## Scalability Test Scenarios

### 4-Processor Configuration
```
A: 3 slots, cooperative, 0.1 bias
B: 4 slots, aggressive, 0.7 bias  
C: 5 slots, strategic, 0.4 bias
D: 3 slots, aggressive, 0.8 bias
```

**Coordination Complexity**: Moderate increase in alliance possibilities and trust network effects

### 6-Processor Configuration

### Scalability Observations
- **Coordination Overhead**: Increases with processor count
- **Trust Network Effects**: More complex reputation propagation

### Coordination Effectiveness Validation

All scenarios demonstrate:

- ✅ **Trust-based reputation** system effectiveness  
- ✅ **Dynamic coalition** formation and management
- ✅ **Adaptive resource allocation** through competitive mechanisms
- ✅ **System resilience** to coordination challenges

These scenarios collectively validate that sophisticated coordination can emerge from simple trust-based rules when agents possess strategic reasoning capabilities and face real consequences for their coordination choices.
