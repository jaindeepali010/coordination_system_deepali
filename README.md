# Distributed Processor Coordination System

## System Overview

This system addresses the fundamental challenge of **Resource Contention Coordination** where autonomous processor agents must compete for limited CPU time slots without central coordination. Each processor agent operates as an independent LLM-powered entity with conflicting objectives: minimize their own execution time while maintaining system-wide efficiency.

## Coordination Philosophy

Our approach demonstrates **emergent coordination** through:

- **Trust-based Reputation Systems**: Agents develop trust scores based on observed honesty vs. deception
- **Dynamic Coalition Formation**: Real-time alliance building between competing processors
- **Adaptive Bidding Mechanisms**: Trust-modulated resource allocation with severe penalties for dishonest behavior
- **Memory-driven Strategy Evolution**: LLM agents learn and adapt based on historical coordination experiences

## The Core Challenge

### Resource Contention Problem
- **Limited Resource**: Single CPU execution slot per time unit
- **Competing Agents**: Multiple processors with conflicting burst time requirements
- **No Central Coordinator**: Agents must self-organize through peer-to-peer negotiation
- **Asymmetric Information**: Agents have private knowledge (true burst times) and public claims
- **Dynamic Participation**: Processors complete and leave the coordination system

### Key Innovations

1. **LLM-Powered Strategic Reasoning**: Each agent uses GPT-4o for sophisticated negotiation and bidding strategies
2. **Trust-Penalty Bidding**: Dishonest agents face exponential bid effectiveness penalties (up to 99% reduction)
3. **Emergent Coalition Dynamics**: Temporary alliances form and dissolve based on strategic needs
4. **Memory-Driven Adaptation**: Agents remember past interactions and adapt strategies accordingly

## System Properties Demonstrated

- **Emergent Coordination**: No pre-programmed workflows, coordination emerges from agent interactions
- **Conflict Resolution Under Uncertainty**: Agents resolve competing goals with incomplete information
- **Adaptive Resource Allocation**: Dynamic negotiation for CPU time slots without central allocator
- **Fault-Tolerant Cooperation**: System continues functioning as agents complete and leave

## Quick Start

```bash
cd coordination_system_deepali/implementation
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
python main.py
```

## Architecture Highlights

- **Distributed State Management**: Each agent maintains private and observable state
- **Multi-Phase Coordination**: Initialization → Negotiation → Coalition → Bidding → Execution
- **Production-Critical Validation**: Strict lifecycle management prevents "ghost" participation
- **Trust Evolution**: Dynamic reputation system with severe penalties for deception
